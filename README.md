# Surfs Up

## Overview
Surfs Up is a concept shop where surfing and ice cream are combined.  In order to determine if this business idea is sustainable year-round, some analysis needed to be done of the weather in Oahu, HI; specifically the temperature differences between June and December.

## Results
> **Temperature:**
*June versus December*
- Minimum: 64.0 deg F versus 56.0 deg F
- Average:  74.9 deg F versus 71.0 deg F
- Maximum: 85.0 deg F versus 83.0 deg F

> **Precipitation:**
*June versus December*
- Minimum: 0.0" versus 0.0"
- Average: 0.15" versus 0.24"
- Maximum: 1.39" versus 3.14"

*Note that the precipitation is from the station that recorded the highest number of days overall.*
- Minimum temperatures are not dramatically different between June and December.  Typically, there is only about a 2 to 4 degree difference.  The minimum recorded in June was, however, 8 degrees warmer that the minimum recorded in December.  
- Precipitation appears to be higher in December by more than double.

## Summary
It looks as though the weather for June and December are both relatively steady and would support Surfs Up year-round.  With the temperatures averaging very close to the same in through both seasons and average rainfall not being excessive, the business model should be able to function as desired.
